							<h2 class="mb-4"> Why e-learning.? </h2>
							<p>
								Due to the problems faced by the traditional education system, we have developed a solution and added more enhancements to the quality of the education system by exploring the methodology used by the developed countries, and their technologies. Here, we aim to create a new culture of education using modern technologies. 
								 One of the problems in current learning is not having enough time for devoting to learning due to a busy life. Even though we thought tuition classes are better than school education, it isn't like that. Both parties have their different problems. Mainly due to missed lessons, and an inability to understand them caused the major problems in this learning system. Also, there isn't an easy and proper way to re-learn them it means, there is no precise way to study them again and again until it cleared without causing more time and money. Providing definitive solutions to these problems and others will accommodate to improve the mechanism of the learning system. That is why E-learning.
